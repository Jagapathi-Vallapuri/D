{"type": "bot_response", "content": "In the **Discussion** section, skin ulceration was highlighted as a critical prognostic factor because:  \n1. **Strong Association with Poor Survival**: Multivariate analysis identified skin ulceration (HR = 2.462) as significantly linked to shorter overall survival compared to other clinicopathological factors like tumor size or lymph node status. This indicates its independent predictive value for adverse outcomes.  \n\n2. **Biological Significance in Feline Patients**: Cats with feline mammary carcinoma are particularly susceptible to infections and inflammatory complications due to their physiology. Skin ulceration exacerbates local invasion, increases infection risk (e.g., abscesses), and complicates recovery post-surgery or treatment\u2014factors that disproportionately worsen prognosis compared to human breast cancer models where such inflammation is less prevalent.  \n\n3. **Need for Risk Stratification**: By integrating skin ulceration into the new **T4** category (Stage IIIB: T\u2084N\u2080M\u2080), the staging system explicitly captures its prognostic impact, allowing better differentiation of high-risk cases and guiding tailored interventions. This adjustment addresses gaps in existing veterinary systems that failed to distinguish survival differences between large tumors (>3 cm) versus ulcerative or locally invasive ones.  \n\nThus, skin ulceration is highlighted as a marker of aggressive tumor behavior, local invasiveness, and heightened susceptibility to complications\u2014warranting its inclusion in the refined staging framework for improved prognostic accuracy and treatment planning.", "metadata": {"type": "rag_answer", "selected_document": "40150308", "selection_score": 3.320585298538208, "documents_considered": 11}, "timestamp": "2025-07-18T17:09:38.627860"}
