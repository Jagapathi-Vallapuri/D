{"type": "bot_response", "content": "The diagnosis of leukemia caused significant shock among participants even when the term \"leukemia\" was disclosed but not explicitly labeled as **cancer**, due to:  \n1. **Misunderstanding disease severity**: Participants initially associated leukemia with conditions like severe anemia rather than recognizing it as a life-threatening blood cancer, leading to confusion and fear upon realizing its true nature (e.g., statements about interpreting \"leukemia\" as something minor or non-critical).  \n2. **Psychological impact of the word \u201ccancer\u201d**: The term evokes widespread stigmatization linked to death, suffering, and social isolation in public consciousness, amplifying patients\u2019 fears despite medical explanations. Participants described terror over mortality (e.g., \"I couldn\u2019t brush my teeth because blood came out\u2026 I thought I was going to die\").  \n3. **Lack of contextual knowledge**: The disconnect between the diagnosis name (\"leukemia\") and its classification as cancer highlights gaps in public understanding, where certain cancers remain poorly conceptualized or misrepresented socially (e.g., leukemia is sometimes perceived as a lesser-known blood condition rather than an aggressive malignancy).  \n\nThis reveals that **social representation of cancer** perpetuates stigma through:  \n- Associating the term with fatal outcomes and emotional burden.  \n- Failing to educate about specific cancers, leaving patients vulnerable to shock due to unanticipated severity or inadequate preparation for their diagnosis.", "metadata": {"type": "rag_answer", "selected_document": "Enhertu_2", "selection_score": 2.810830815492892, "documents_considered": 8}, "timestamp": "2025-07-18T18:58:33.294802"}
