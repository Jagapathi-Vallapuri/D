{"type": "bot_response", "content": "The researchers adapted the seventh edition of the **AJCC Cancer Staging Manual** for feline mammary carcinoma due to several key reasons:\n\n1.  **Superior Granularity in Stage III Classification:**  \n    The existing veterinary system grouped all large tumors (>3 cm) or lymph node involvement into a single \"Stage III\" category, despite their distinct prognostic implications (e.g., tumor size vs. metastasis). By subdividing this stage using AJCC criteria:\n    \n        *   **IIIA** = Tumors > 3 cm without regional spread\n        *   **IIIB** = Locally invasive tumors regardless of size with tissue extension/skin ulceration/inflammatory types\n        *   **IIIC** = Regional lymph node metastasis irrespective of tumor size\n\n2. This allowed more precise prognostic stratification and treatment planning compared to the less-differentiated WHO system.\n\n3.  **Emphasis on Anatomical Pathology:**  \n    The AJCC system focuses primarily on anatomical features (tumor dimensions, local invasion) rather than molecular markers or genetic subtypes \u2013 making it particularly suitable for veterinary medicine where advanced diagnostics may be limited or inaccessible [41].\n\n---\n\n**Supporting Contextual Evidence:**\n\n- Page 3 explicitly states the selection rationale:\n    > \"This system prioritizes anatomical and pathological features [...] Additionally, it offers sufficient granularity [...] while remaining practical\" (Section 2.4).\n    \n- The need for refinement was highlighted by limitations in WHO staging ([9], [15], [39]).\n\n---\n\n**Outcome:**  \nThe adapted AJCC-based NS system demonstrated improved survival prediction compared to the original WHO classification, particularly distinguishing Stage IIIC lymph node involvement from other III subcategories (median OS differences up to ~200 days) and better aligned with known prognostic factors like ulceration/lymphovascular invasion.", "metadata": {"type": "rag_answer", "selected_document": "40150308", "selection_score": 3.412975526540756, "documents_considered": 6}, "timestamp": "2025-07-18T17:18:50.970573"}

{"type": "bot_response", "content": "### Critical Role of Skin Ulceration as a Prognostic Factor  \n\nIn the **Discussion** section, skin ulceration is highlighted as a critical prognostic factor due to its strong association with:  \n- **Poorer overall survival (OS)** (*p < 0.01*) and reduced disease-free interval (DFI). Ulcerated tumors correlate with aggressive local invasion and increased metastatic risk compared to non-ulcerative lesions, even when other factors like tumor size or lymph node status are controlled.  \n\n**Why it warrants inclusion in a T4 category:**  \n- **Biological aggressiveness**: Skin ulceration reflects deeper tissue disruption and inflammatory responses that may enhance carcinoma invasiveness. Studies (e.g., Seixas et al., 2011) confirm its independent prognostic value, distinguishing cats with worse outcomes despite similar staging criteria in the WHO system.  \n- **Treatment implications**: Ulcerated tumors are linked to higher surgical complication rates and poorer response to adjuvant therapies (Vilela & Valente et al.), necessitating tailored management strategies for high-risk cases.  \n\nThe proposed T4 category integrates this feature into staging, addressing a key gap in granularity where ulceration\u2014a marker of advanced local disease\u2014was previously overlooked in standardized systems like WHO Stage III.
